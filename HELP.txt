Features:

1)No images used anywhere in the game. Everything is create by using shapes in openGL. This ensures the loading of the game is quick and efficient.
2)Rendered text/numbers without the help of any libraries (only using shapes).
3)Collision using boxes(not circles), this is a lot more effective when blocks are of uneven size.


Note:

All objects are sorted into different layers. Each layer is drawn one at a time. Some layers are more prefered and will be drawn last  whereas others will be drawn earlier (Like the background layer). Within a layer objects are drawn in a lexicographical order. These two together give you the ability to draw complex objects with ease.
